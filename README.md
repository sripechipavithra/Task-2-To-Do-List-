# task 2 — To-Do List Web App

This is my submission for the **To-Do List web application project**.  
I built a simple and modern task manager using **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**.

---

## What the app can do
- Add new tasks with an optional due date  
- Mark tasks as complete or remove them  
- Edit tasks by double-clicking  
- Assign priority (Low, Medium, High)  
- Search tasks by text  
- Clear all completed tasks at once  
- Track overall progress with a progress bar  
- Tasks are saved in the browser with localStorage  

---

## How I built it
- **HTML** for structure  
- **CSS** for styling with a clean, responsive design  
- **JavaScript** for all functionality (add, toggle, edit, search, clear)  
- Used **localStorage** to save tasks so they persist after refresh
